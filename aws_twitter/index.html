<p>
Assaf Mentzer from AWS put together a very useful learing project in November of 2015, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/building-a-near-real-time-discovery-platform-with-aws/">'Building a Near Real-Time Disovery Platform with AWS'</a>.
</p>
<p>
 Since then there seem to have been a few changes in some of the AWS services he used. This page updates Assaf's instructions and adds a few additional tips for anyone getting started with the project. These steps are fairly complete, but they are a suplement, and not a replacement, for Assaf's work. I hope it helps others with the demo.

<h1>Prerequisites</h1>
<p>
No real changes here. The only note is to consider using a new Twitter account instead of your usual one (if you have one) so as not to confuse your usual settings with these data explorations.

<h1>Create Amazon Elasticsearch Service cluster</h1>
<ol>
   <li>Sign in to the Elastic Search Service Console.</li>
   <li>If this is your first time choose 'Get Started', otherwise choose 'Create a New Domain'.<br>
   <a target="_blank" href="screen-shots/001..elastic-search-blank.jpg"><img src="screen-shots/001..elastic-search-blank.jpg"></a></li>
   <li>Name your domain "es-twitter-demo" and choose 'Next'.</li>
   <li>After naming the domain for your elasticsearch service Assaf recommends accepting the defaults on the next page. The defaults are reasonable, but it is a bit cheaper to use a smaller EC instance to host the elasticsearch domain. The t2.medium.elasticsearch works well for simple experimentation.</li>
   <li>Choose 'Allow Open Access' as the domain policy. <br>NOTE: This is a poor security practice and the console will complain about it.<br>
   <a target="_blank" href="screen-shots/002..domain-access-policy.jpg"><img src="screen-shots/002..domain-access-policy.jpg"></a></li>
   <li>Choose 'Confirm and Create'. It takes about 10 minutes for the domain to be set up.<br>
   <a target="_blank" href="screen-shots/003..domain-creation-confirmation.jpg"><img src="screen-shots/003..domain-creation-confirmation.jpg"></a></li>
   <li>When the endpoint is active, click on it.<br>
   <a target="_blank" href="screen-shots/004..domain-active-confirmation.jpg"><img src="screen-shots/004..domain-active-confirmation.jpg"></a></li>
   <li>The service console will display various details about the newly created service endpoint. Note this information down for later, especially the Eleasticsearch service endpoint and the Kibana URL.<br>
