The state Maryland contributed a collection of <a href="https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/traffic-violations-5    6dda/resource/450018e7-f6c0-43fd-b5c9-a83de293b206">traffic violation data</a>. This data looked like it would be a useful tool to shed light o    n a commonly held belief, that more tickets are issued at the end of the month in order for officers to 'meet quota'. The MD Traffic Data did s    hed light on that question, but it also raised a few more.</p>
