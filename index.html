<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
Assaf Mentzer from AWS put together a very useful learing project in November of 2015, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/building-a-near-real-time-discovery-platform-with-aws/">'Building a Near Real-Time Disovery Platform with AWS'</a>. Since then there seem to have been a few changes in some of the AWS services he used. This page updates Assaf's instructions and adds a few additional tips for anyone getting started with the project.
